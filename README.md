# Alchimage

A cute little Mac application used to copy image assets over to a image template folder. 
Graphic artists often send image assets to developers to import into their projects (splash screens, background images, 
app icons, etc).

Rather than having to copy tons images assets into your project and go through the trouble of having to rename each image
file -- this will help save some time.

The program takes an image asset folder (images from graphic artist) and matches up the dimensions of each image in your 
template folder and replaces each image asset file name with the template file name that it matched.

Here's an example of a template folder (destination folder):
